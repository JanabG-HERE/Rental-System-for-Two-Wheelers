# Rental-System-for-Two-Wheelers
The Indian automotive industry is one great example of a segment that experienced a rapid boom in the last few years. The industry now only kept dominating the market through its existing segments, but also provided new segments that proved equally successful as time passed. The Two-Wheeler rental industry is a new segment that has started to climb the ladder of success after surviving its initial phase in India. With the emergence of the Two-Wheeler rental business vertical in the mobility sector, the essence of the Two-Wheeler Rental System is appreciated more than ever.  There is no denying that tourists and student areas of the city are the primary target audiences for any Two-Wheeler rental firm in India. In fact, another major fact is that modern-day tourists, especially youngsters prefer to hire two-wheelers and explore the city rather than hire a car. But the main problem here is that tourists have to search for rental shops on google or the online internet and go to the location to hire a two-wheeled vehicle which is a very time-consuming process.  Also recently, due to fuel prices and pollution electric vehicles such as electric scooters have popped up everywhere. They’re fast, fun, and pretty much affordable for everyone. They’re now available in most major cities and are the future of transportation.
